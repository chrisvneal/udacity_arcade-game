# Front End Nanodegree Project 3: Arcade Game
I created this project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree (FEND) program. What a challenge, but I worked through this project using literally everything I know about JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming, using ES6 syntax! 

I will making improvememnts as necessary to the game, so please check back!

If you have any questions, please contact me!!

## Starting the game
 The game is already running! To begin playing, simply move the character using any directional arrow _(up, down, left, right)_ on your keyboard.

 ## Goal
 The goal of the game is to reach the water (the other side) before getting attacked by a cute ladybug!

 ## Game rules
 * You **LOSE** when you get hit 4 times

 * **3 points** will increase the difficulty to **MEDIUM**, bugs move fast!

 * **6 points** will increase the difficulty to **HARD**, bugs move at super speed! (only for the elite player)!

 Enjoy the game!

# Front End Nanodegree Project 3: Arcade Game
I created this project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree (FEND) program. What a challenge, but I worked through this project using literally everything I know about JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming, using ES6 syntax! 

I will making improvememnts as necessary to the game, so please check back!

If you have any questions, please contact me!!
